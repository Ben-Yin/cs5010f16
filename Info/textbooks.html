<strong>Scheme Readings</strong>

<p> If you wish to learn to use Scheme as a tool, which is <font
		color="red"><b>not</b></font> the goal of this course,
		then take a look at the following:

<ul>
	<li>The manuals in the Help Desk for the libraries in DrScheme</li>

<li>The <a href=" http://schemecookbook.org/">Scheme cookbook</a>, 
	a collection of Scheme programming recipes</li>
	</li>

<li>Dybvig. <i><a href="http://www.scheme.com/tspl4/"> The Scheme
Programming Language, 4rd edition </a></i> MIT Press, 2004</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Other Readings</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If your native language is not English, or even if it is, the
following book will help you improve your writing:

<p>Strunk and White <i>The Elements of Style</a></i> Longman (1918,
4th ed., 1999). A useful resource on English grammar and usage.  Also
contains many good tips on style. It is not perfect, but it has a lot
of good content.  It is available <a
href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html" target="new">online</a>
but it's far more useful to have the 105-page paperback in your hand,
or on your desk to inspire you. </li>

<li>The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People by Stephen
R. Covey. (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671708635/002-6581688-4343265?v=glance"
target="habits">Amazon</a>) Most graduate students need some help with
managing their time, and this only gets harder as you go along. This
is one of the classic books on time management. It gives guidance on
juggling competing demands on your time, setting (and keeping!)
priorities, and the psychological dimension of time management. I've
had a number of students who found this book invaluable.</li>

<li>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, by David
Allen.  (<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262211678&sr=1-1"
target="gtd">Amazon</a>)  This is a system of keeping track of your tasks.  It
is extremely nerd-friendly (and I mean that in a good way).
</li>

<!-- <li>For many of you, this course will be an exercise in personal growth as -->
<!-- you learn to approach tasks in a new way, take criticism, and work in -->
<!-- a very intensive environment.   If you have some favorite books on -->
<!-- this topic, now is a good time to get them out.  Here is one that I -->
<!-- like:</p> -->

<!-- <p>Zen Guitar, by Philip Toshio Sudo. (<a -->
<!-- href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Guitar-Philip-Toshio-Sudo/dp/068483877X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262212032&sr=1-1" -->
<!-- target="zen">Amazon</a>) When he says "welcome to my dojo", read -->
<!-- "welcome to *my* dojo".  When he says "Pick up your guitar" read "Pick -->
<!-- up your HtDP book, a sheet of paper to design on, and then (and only -->
<!-- then) your keyboard and mouse."  When he says "practice with -->
<!-- intention", read "design the most beautiful program you can."  (And so -->
<!-- far as I know, that is the author's real name: it is not a linux -->
<!-- joke).</li> -->
