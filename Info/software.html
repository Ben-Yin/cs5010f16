<h1>Preparing Your Laptop For CS5010</h1>

<div id="menu">

<div id="content">

<p> You will need to do several things to get your machine ready for
CS 5010.  Please have these done <strong>before</strong> the first
meeting of CS 5011.  If you have difficulty with any of them, we will
help you at the first lab meeting.  </p>

<p>If you do not have a laptop or personal computer, you still need to
do all the steps here except for those that require you to install
software on your local computer.</p>

<p>Please record the time you spend on this setup in your <a
href="laboratory-notebook.html " >laboratory notebook</a>, and turn in
this notebook along with your solution to the exercises at the end of
<a href="../Modules/module00.html" >Module 00</a>.

<ol>

    <li><strong>Sign up for a CCIS account.</strong> Follow the
  instructions <a
  href="http://howto.ccs.neu.edu/howto/accounts-homedirs/how-to-sign-up-for-a-ccis-account/"
  >here</a>.

  <!-- There will be staff to collect forms in 102 WVH (days -->
  <!-- and hours to be announced). -->

  This may take up to 48 hours, so start
  this process as soon as you can.

  <p>A word of advice: Once you choose a username, you can't change
  it, so choose wisely. Employers are likely to be communicating with
  you via your ccis username, so choose a name that is professional.
  <kbd>Drinkzmore</kbd>, for example, would be a bad choice. </p>

  </li>

  <li><strong>If you do not have a copy of PowerPoint, please get
  one.</strong>  It is my understanding that effective Fall 2014, all
  students will have free access to Microsoft Office 365 for Windows
  and Macs.

  Here is the latest information I have:
  <em>This September
  Northeastern students will be able to download the latest version of
  Microsoft Office - Office 2013 for Windows and Office 2011 for Mac -
  for FREE through the Microsoft Student Advantage program. Students
  will be able to install the digital version on up to five
  devices. Details will be posted on the ITS website and the myNEU
  portal at the end of the summer. </em> </p> 

  <p>Students will see the Office 365 channel in myNeu under
  self-service.  (As of 8/25/14, this has not yet appeared. I believe
  it will be available effective 9/1/14.)  Currently there is a
  version available on myNeu for $80.  Don't buy this one-- wait for the free
  version. </p>

  <!-- You -->
  <!-- can obtain a discounted copy of Microsoft Office 365 University -->
  <!-- Edition by going to myNeu >> Services and Links >> Free and -->
  <!-- Discounted Software (in the lower-right corner). (You will need to -->
  <!-- login again here. I had some difficulty doing this; I did get in -->
  <!-- after a few tries.)   The student -->
  <!-- edition of Office 2013 is $79.95 for a 4-year subscription.  For -->
  <!-- this course, you -->
  <!-- will only need to view PowerPoint presentations, not create them, so -->
  <!-- if you have an alternate way of viewing PowerPoint presentations, -->
  <!-- feel free to use it. -->

  <p/></li>

  <li><strong>Sign up for CS 5010 on piazza.com at <a href="
  https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2014/cs5010/home" >
  https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2014/cs5010/home</a>.</strong>  Please
  use your CCIS email as your Piazza login. We will
  be using Piazza as our primary vehicle for online discussion. Be
  sure to read the notes about <a href="netiquette.html"
  >communication</a>.<p/>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Make sure your wireless is working.</strong>  Make sure
  you can connect to one of the following networks:
  <p/>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>NUWave</strong>: You will need your husky.neu.edu
  credentials.  Available all over campus, but not on the upper floors
  of WVH.</li>
  
  <li><strong>NUWave-Guest</strong>: Like NUWave, but does not require
  credentials.  You will need to accept the usage agreement every time
  you connect.</li>
  
  <li><strong>CCIS-Wireless</strong>: Log in with your myNeu
  credentials.  You should be able to store your credentials so you
  only need to authenticate once.  Available only in
  WVH.</li>

  <li><strong>CCIS-Wireless-Guest</strong>: Log in on a splash page
  with your myNeu credentials.  Available only in WVH.</li>
  

</ul><p/>
  </li>



  <li><strong>Download and Install Racket on your laptop.</strong> Go
      to <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org" target=_blank
      >www.racket-lang.org</a> and download and install the latest
      version of Racket (v6.0.1, June, 2014, or later).  Racket is available
      for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.  Choose the version that is
      right for your system. <p/> </li>

  <li><strong>Sign up for <a href="https://github.com"
  >Github</a>.</strong> We will be using github as our repository and
  version control system in this course.  To use github, you will need
  to do a few things: </p>

      <ul>

	<li> Register yourself at <a href="https://github.com"
	>Github</a>. Use your CCIS login name as your github name, if
	that is possible. If you are already on github, you need not
	create a new account.  We will be creating a web form where
	you can link your CCIS username, your husky.neu address, and
	your github accout.  </li>

	<li> Go to <a
	href="http://gravatar.com" >gravatar.com</a> to upload a
	picture of yourself to appear on github.  This will be helpful
	to the course staff when we review your repositories.</li>

	<!-- <em>using your CCIS login name</em>.  You can link -->
	<!-- your gitub account to any email address you like. If you are -->
	<!-- already on github, you will still need to create a different -->
	<!-- account for this course.  Github only allows you to create one -->
	<!-- account for each email address, but you can get around this by -->
	<!-- linking your account to <em>foo+cs5010@bar.com</em>, where -->
	<!-- <em>foo@bar.com</em> is any real email address.  Please go to -->
	<!-- <a href="http://gravatar.com" >gravatar.com</a> to upload a -->
	<!-- picture of yourself.  This will be helpful to the course staff -->
	<!-- when we review your repositories.</li> -->

	<li> Download and install a github client.  We
	recommend <a href="http://windows.github.com/" >Github for
	Windows</a> and <a href="http://mac.github.com/" >Github for
	Mac</a>. If you are using Linux, use the git package that came 
	with your linux distribution.
	</li>
      </ul>

</ul>
