<ul>

<li>The deliverables for each problem are listed <a href="#perquestion"
>below</a>.</li> 

<li> You must also turn in a laboratory notebook that records the time
 you spent on each question.  The notebook should be in a file named
 <kbd>notebook.txt</kbd> The exact format of the laboratry notebook is
 specified <a href="laboratory-notebook.html" >here</a>.  </li>

<li> At the end of each work session, you must commit your work
 (including your laboratory notebook) to
 your <a href="git.html" >github</a> repository.  We will assign a
 repository to each student.  Initially, this repository will be
 located at
 <kbd>https://github.com/cs5010f14/pdp-YOUR-CCIS-LOGIN-NAME</kbd> .
 You will receive notification of the exact name of your repository.
 Later on, we will be creating private repositories for each
 pair.</li>

<li>You must also show this commit as an entry in your <xa
href="laboratory-notebook.html" >laboratory notebook</a>.</li>

<li>If you do not check in your assignments nightly, we will
assume that you are not working on the assignment.  Checking in your
partially-completed assignments also serves to prove that you actually
did the assignment yourself. If you only check in the final version of
your assignment, we will assume that you probably stole the code from
somewhere.  </li>

<li> Nightly check-ins mean that you will always have a backup of your
work.  If you screw things up, you can always revert to an earlier
version.  </li>

<li>You must commit your solutions for problem set JJ to your
 repository, in a folder named <kbd>setJJ</kbd>.  Each question should
 be submitted as a single file in that folder, in a file named
 <kbd>NAME.rkt</kbd>, where <kbd>NAME.rkt</kbd> is the filename
 specified in the question.  If the question does not specify a
 filename, then use <kbd>K.rkt</kbd> for question K.  Thus, if problem
 set 1, question 2 does not specify a filename, then the answer should
 be in a file named exactly <kbd>set01/2.rkt</kbd>, not
 <kbd>set1/2.rkt</kbd>, <kbd>Set01/2.rkt</kbd>, <kbd>set
 1/question2.rkt</kbd>, or anything else.  Here I've used the Unix
 convention of using <kbd>/</kbd> to separate the components of a path
 name.  If you do not use the proper folder and filenames for your
 solutions, you will break our scripts and you <em>will</em> be
 penalized.  </li>

<li>Your homework will be collected automatically from your <a
href="git.html" >github</a> repository at the date and time listed on
 the problem set (usually 6pm local time on Monday). </li>

<li>Your submission will be graded according to <a
href="master-rubric-public.txt" >this rubric</a>. The rubric will change
somewhat from week to week, but this shows the general outline. </li>

<li>We have <a href="coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.
If you follow them, you will make your life and the TA's life easier.</li>




<a name="perquestion">
<h2>Design Recipe Deliverables</h2>

<p>Here are the items you need to include for each question:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>For Each Data Definition:</Strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    <li>A set of <kbd>struct</kbd> definitions, if necessary.</li>
    
    <li>A specification of how to build values for this data definition.</li>

    <li>An interpretation, explaining
    the meaning of each element in the data in terms of the information it
    represents.
    </li>

    <li>A template for using structural decomposition on this kind of
    data.</li>

    <li>Examples if they will be helpful in understanding the
    interpretation, or for use in tests.  If the examples are
    primarily for use in tests, you may put them near the tests.
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  <p/>
</li>

  <li><strong>For Each Function:</strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    
    <li>Contract: a specification of data definitions for the
    arguments and the result.  If you write

    <pre>
    list-numbered : ListOf&lt;Number> Number -> ListOf&lt;Number>
</pre>

    then your function must take <em>any</em> list of numbers and
    <em>any</em> number and produce the output that is described by
    the purpose statement, unless the contract is qualified by an
    invariant (WHERE-clause).  We will talk about WHERE-clauses in
    module 7.

</li>

    <a name="purpose-statement">
    <li>Purpose Statement:</li> A short noun phrase describing
    <em>what</em> the function is supposed to return. Typically
    phrased in terms of information, not data.  Generally takes the
    form GIVEN/WHERE/RETURNS, where each of these keywords is followed
    by a short noun phrase.  Examples:

    <pre>
    GIVEN: a temperature in Fahrenheit
    RETURNS: the corresponding temperature in Celsius

    GIVEN: a Cat c and a Scene s
    RETURNS: A scene like s, except that the cat c has been painted on it.

    GIVEN: a list of numbers lon and a number n
    WHERE: n = (length lon)
    RETURNS: a list of numbers like lon, except that each number is
    multiplied by its distance from the end of the list.
    </pre>

    <p>You may omit the GIVEN clause by referring to the givens in the
    RETURNS clause. Sometimes this is easier than writing a GIVENS
    clause, sometimes it is harder.  Examples:

     <pre>
    RETURNS: the temperature in Celsius that corresponds to the given
    Fahrenheit temperature.

    RETURNS: A scene like the given one, except that the given cat has
    been painted on it.
    </pre>

</p>

    <li>Examples</li>

    <li>Design Strategy: the name of the design strategy used for this
    function. If the strategy is "structural decomposition", specify
    which argument and which data definition you are using. Example:

<pre>
      ;; bombs-after-tick : ListOf&lt;Bomb&gt; Number -&gt; ListOf&lt;Bomb&gt;
      ;; ...[purpose statement and examples omitted]...
      ;; Strategy: structural decomposition on bombs : ListOf&lt;Bomb&gt;
      (define (bombs-after-tick bombs amt)
        (cond
          [(empty? bombs) empty]
          [else (cons (bomb-after-tick (first bombs) amt)
                      (bombs-after-tick (rest bombs) amt))])) 
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>The function definition.  If your strategy is "structural
    decomposition", then your code must match the template for the
    appropriate data definition. </li>

    <li>The tests.  Generally, you will define a test suite for each
    function by writing
  <pre>
(begin-for-test
  (check-equal?
    (length lobs-1)
    (length (bombs-after-tick lobs-1))
    "bombs-after-tick did not return a list the same length as its input")
    ...)
</pre>

    <p>Tests created with <kbd>begin-for-test</kbd> will be run at the
    end of the file.</p>

    </li>

  </ol>

</li>
</ul>
