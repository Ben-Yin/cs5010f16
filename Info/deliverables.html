<h1>Design Recipe Deliverables</h1>




<p>Here are the items you need to include for each question:
</p>


<ul>
  <li>
  <strong>For Each Data Definition:</Strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    <li>A set of <kbd>struct</kbd> definitions, if necessary.</li>
    
    <li>A <em>constructor template</em> that specifies how to build
    values for this data definition.</li> 

    <li>An <em>interpretation</em>, explaining
    the meaning of each element in the data in terms of the information it
    represents.  The meaning should be the meaning of the data, not of
    how it used in the program.
    </li>

    <li>A <em>destructor template</em> for examining values of this kind of
    data.</li>

    <li>Examples if they will be helpful in understanding the
    interpretation, or for use in tests.  If the examples are
    primarily for use in tests, you may put them near the tests.
    </li>
    
  </ol>
  <p/>
</li>

  <li><strong>For Each Function:</strong>
  <p/>

  <ol>
    
    <li>Contract: a specification of data definitions for the
    arguments and the result.  If you write

    <pre>
    list-numbered : ListOf&lt;Number> Number -> ListOf&lt;Number>
</pre>

    then your function must take <em>any</em> list of numbers and
    <em>any</em> number and produce the output that is described by
    the purpose statement, unless the contract is qualified by an
    invariant (WHERE-clause).  We will talk about WHERE-clauses in
    module 7.

</li>

    <a name="purpose-statement">
    <li>Purpose Statement:</li> A short noun phrase describing
    <em>what</em> the function is supposed to return. Typically
    phrased in terms of information, not data.  Generally takes the
    form GIVEN/WHERE/RETURNS, where each of these keywords is followed
    by a short noun phrase.  Examples:

    <pre>
    GIVEN: a temperature in Fahrenheit
    RETURNS: the corresponding temperature in Celsius

    GIVEN: a Cat c and a Scene s
    RETURNS: A scene like s, except that the cat c has been painted on it.

    GIVEN: a list of numbers lon and a number n
    WHERE: n = (length lon)
    RETURNS: a list of numbers like lon, except that each number is
    multiplied by its distance from the end of the list.
    </pre>

    <p>You may omit the GIVEN clause by referring to the givens in the
    RETURNS clause. Sometimes this is easier than writing a GIVENS
    clause, sometimes it is harder.  Examples:

     <pre>
    RETURNS: the temperature in Celsius that corresponds to the given
    Fahrenheit temperature.

    RETURNS: A scene like the given one, except that the given cat has
    been painted on it.
    </pre>

</p>

    <li>Examples.  The examples should illustrate the different
    behaviors of the function.</li>

    <li>Design Strategy: A short description of how to get from the
    purpose statement to the function definition.  These will
    typically be one of the following phrases:
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine simpler functions </li>
      <li>Use template for [data definition] on [variable]</li>
      <li>Divide into cases on [condition]</li>
      <li>Use HOF [mapfcn] on [variable]</li>
      <li>Call a more general function</li>
      <li>[Initialize|Update] state of [??]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the first few problem sets, you will use ONLY strategies
    1-3.  We will cover the last three in later modules.</p>
    <p>When we get closer to the end of the course, we will let you
    describe your own strategies.  Your strategy should be what you
    would tweet to a friend to describe what you did.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>The function definition.  If your strategy is "Use Template",
    then your code must match the template for the appropriate data
    definition. </li>

    <li>The tests.  Generally, you will define a test suite for each
    function by writing
  <pre>
(begin-for-test
  (check-equal?
    (length lobs-1)
    (length (bombs-after-tick lobs-1))
    "bombs-after-tick did not return a list the same length as its input")
    ...)
</pre>

    <p>Tests created with <kbd>begin-for-test</kbd> will be run at the
    end of the file.</p>

    </li>

  </ol>

</li>
