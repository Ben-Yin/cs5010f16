In this course, we will use <a href="https://github.com" >Github</a>
as our version control and repository system.

<p>Git is a version control system.  With git, you keep a
master copy of your project on the github server, plus you can keep a copy on
each computer that you use to work on the project.  (For example, I
have a master copy of these web pages on the server, plus a copy on
each of the three computers that I typically work on).  If you are
working on a pair project, you might keep one copy on each partner's
machine.</p>

<p>A general introduction to git can be found in <a
href="../Slides/Lesson 0.5 Introduction to Git.pptx" >Lesson 0.5</a>.
This includes a  <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thrpcSzdvso" >video demonstration</a>.


<p>
Your daily workflow with git looks as follows:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Always start a work session by opening up your github client
  (either <a href="http://windows.github.com/" >Github for
  Windows</a>, <a href="http://mac.github.com/" >Github for Mac</a>,
  or your command-line client), opening your repository, and hitting
  "refresh". (You may need to go to the dashboard to get it to
  refresh). This will get the latest versions of all the files from
  the server and put them into your local copy.  In what follows,
  we'll assume you are using GHFW or GHFM; we'll refer to these as
  GHF*. </li>

  <li>Do your work.</li>

  <li>As soon as you change or add files during your work session, the
  text in GHF* that says "No uncommitted changes" will change to
  "uncommitted changes".  You can commit your changes by clicking on
  "show" and choosing the changes (including new files) that you want
  to commit. When you do this, the little checkmark at the top of the
  window that says "in sync" will change to "sync".  Click this icon
  to publish your changes to the server.  We recommend you do this
  often.   It is helpful if you use informative messages when you
  commit. </li>

  <li>During your work session, if you decide your changes have broken
  things, and you want to go back to your previous commit, open up a
  shell and say

  <pre>
git checkout master -- <em>filename</em>
</pre>

  This will replace <kbd><em>filename</em></kbd> in your directory
  with the version from the previous commit.  Or you can use "."
  instead of <kbd><em>filename</em></kbd> to revert all the files in
  your current directory to the versions from the preceding commit.

</li>

  <li>At the end of your work session, you <strong>MUST</strong> commit your
  homework assignment AND YOUR LABORATORY NOTEBOOK, and sync your
  changes to the github server.  This gets your new versions onto the
  server, where they will be available for your or your partner at
  your next session.</li>

  <li> Check whether your homework is visible by logging in to <a
  href="https://github.com" >Github</a> in a browser and seeing whether your
  changes are visible there.  You can also do this by clicking "Tools"
  and "View on Github" in GHF*.  <span style="color:red"><em>Be sure to do this step when you are
  submitting your assignment!!</em></span></li>

  <li><strong>NEVER</strong> exchange code by email or other channels.
  <strong>ALWAYS</strong> use the github repository.  That way there is
  never any confusion about which version is the most up-to-date one.
  You can always use git to revert to earlier versions if you need
  to.</li>

</ul>

<p>There's more, but that's the basic idea.</p>

<p>When you see documentation about Git, you will see lots of stuff
about branches, merges, indexes, etc., etc.  Don't worry about any of
that.  If you know about branches and want to use them as part of your
workflow, feel free to do so; just submit your assignments in the
branch <kbd>master</kbd>. </p>

<p>A useful tip: as soon as you get one piece of your task working,
commit it.  (You don't have to sync it until later).  That way, if you
screw things up on the next set of changes, you can always undo your
bad work by clicking on "revert commit"  (not "rollback", unless you
know what you are doing).  Reverting will get you back to the exact
same state you were in when things were working, and you can try again.</p>


<p> Git (and other version control systems) become even more
valuable when there are many people working on a project, perhaps from
many different places.  In a company setting, this is vital, and there
are often restrictions on who can check files into the master copy of
a project.  Luckily we don't have to worry about these complications.
</p>

<p>You may eventually have to deal with the situation in which you and
your partner have committed incompatible changes to the server.  This
situation is discussed in Lesson 0.6</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/resources/git-tutorials-beginners/" >lots</a> and <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1" >lots</a> of tutorial materials on git and github.
Find your favorite on the internet.  If you find some that are
particularly good, please share them with the class by posting links
on Piazza.
