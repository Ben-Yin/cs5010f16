<h1>CS 5011: Lab for Programming Design Paradigms</h1>

<p> The course comes with a <em>lab course</em>, called CS
 5011. Students must register for both courses to receive credit.
 </p>

<p>This course number exists only for bureaucratic reasons.  It will
meet as a course <em>only twice</em>:

<ul>
  <li>9/12-13</li>
  <li>9/19-20</li>
</ul>
  After that, it is replaced by your weekly codewalks.
Here are the details: </p>



<ul> <li>CS 5011 will meet
  
  on 9/12-13 and 9/19-20 

  at the times and places announced by the registrar. These meetings
  will serve as an orientation for the computer systems to be used in CS
  5010.
  
  <li>After that, CS 5011 will not meet at the time in the catalog.
  Instead, you will present some of your homework solutions to the
  TA. These presentations ("codewalks") are critical for the learning
  process and they are key to our evaluation of your progress.</li>

  <a name="codewalks">
  <li> Codewalks will be conducted on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
  Exact times and locations will be announced. We will have some
  codewalk meetings on Thursday evening to accomodate students who
  work full time. Each week you will receive a personal URL at which
  you can sign up for your codewalk session. </li>

  <li>You will meet in groups of 4 students, and each of the four
  students will make a 15-minute presentation on his or her homework.
  When you work in pairs, each pair will make a 30-minute
  presentation.</li>

</ul>
