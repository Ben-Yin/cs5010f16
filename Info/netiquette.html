<h2 align=center>A Little Netiquette</h2> 

Here are some bullet points that will be helpful for our online
  communications.

  <ul>

    <li>First, remember those rules on the back of the form you filled
    out to get your CCIS login?  Well, we take them seriously.  If you
    use your CCIS account for bad things, then bad things WILL happen
    to you.  If you have any questions about an activity that you are
    thinking about, write <a href="mailto:systems@ccs.neu.edu"
    >systems@ccs.neu.edu</a> and ask.  In general, they don't bite and
    will answer serious questions seriously.
    </li>

    <li>Netiquette refers to all your online communication, not just
    those in this class.  You may have been communicating online for
    your entire life, but it's always good to review the basics of
    online conduct.  Here is a useful <a
    href="http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html" >guide</a>. </li>

    <li>We will be using <a href="
    https://piazza.com/northeastern/fall2014/cs5010/home"
    >Piazza</a> for the majority of our online communication. Don't
    write the instructor or the TA via email unless it is absolutely
    necessary. Use Piazza instead.  Piazza allows you to create
    private messages to the instructor if you want.</li>

    <li>Before you post a question, <strong>READ THE EXISTING
    POSTS</strong>.  Often your question has already been
    answered.</li>

    <li> <strong>MAKE YOUR SUBJECT LINE DESCRIPTIVE.</strong>  For example

    <pre>what if mouse is dragged outside the canvas?</pre>

    <p> is much more informative than

    <pre>please help me</pre>

   </li>

    <li><strong>TAG YOUR POSTS.</strong> Piazza uses hashtags, like
   twitter.  I've created standard tags (called "folders" in Piazza)
   in Piazza that will help you (and us) categorize your posts.  (For
   those of you who know, these replace the "forums" in Blackboard).
   These appear under the "Note Tags" box so you can select them with
   a click.</p>

   <ul>
     <li> <kbd>#module0</kbd> ... <kbd>#module12</kbd> for the
     "modules" or "weeks" in the course.  Use these tags to ask
     questions about the online or lecture material for the specified
     week. </li>

     <li><kbd>#ps1</kbd> ... <kbd>#ps10</kbd> for questions about the
     problem sets.

     <li><kbd>#q1</kbd> ... <kbd>#q5</kbd> for questions
     about a particular question in a problem set.  So a post about
     problem set 3, question 2 should be tagged as <kbd>#ps3
     #question2</kbd>. </li>

     <li><kbd>#systems</kbd> for inquiries about the various
     computer systems we use in class.  This is where you can complain
     about difficulties with svn, etc.</li>

   </ul>
<p/>
 </li>

 <li><strong>FEEL FREE TO RESPOND TO EACH OTHER'S POSTS.</strong>
 We won't hold it
 against you if your response is incorrect-- indeed, this will help us
 identify things that the class doesn't understand.</li>
   
</ul>

<p> Following these guidelines will get your questions answered more
quickly.</p>
