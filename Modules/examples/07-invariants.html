<h1>Exercises with invariants</h1>

<p>For these exercises, remember that your purpose statement,
including its invariant, is at least as important as your function
definition.</p>

<p>When you are called on, please copy your solution into one of the
following pages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bitly.com/cs5010f14-solutions-1"
  >solutions-1</a></li> 

  <li><a href="https://bitly.com/cs5010f14-solutions-2"
  >solutions-2</a></li> 

</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Consider the following constructor template for binary trees:

  <pre>
A Bintree is one of
-- (leaf-node Number)
-- (tree-node Number Bintree Bintree)
  </pre>

  Design a function called <kbd>tree-with-leaf-sums</kbd> which, given a
  Bintree, returns a Bintree of the same shape, but in which each leaf
  node is replaced by the sum of all the numbers on the path from the
  root to the leaf.

  <pre>
Example:
#(struct:tree-node 3
   #(struct:tree-node 4
      #(struct:leaf-node 5)
      #(struct:leaf-node 10))
   #(struct:leaf-node 2))

=>

#(struct:tree-node 3
   #(struct:tree-node 4
      #(struct:leaf-node 12)   ; 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
      #(struct:leaf-node 17))  ; 3 + 4 + 10 = 17
   #(struct:leaf-node 5))      ; 3 + 2 = 5
</pre>
  </li>

  <li>Do the same thing, except the data is defined by:

  <pre>
A Bintree is one of
-- Number
-- (list Number Bintree Bintree)
</pre>

<p>Here we are using a list in place of a struct, like we do in ps06.
  In this representation, the tree in the example above would be
  represented (in <kbd>write</kbd> output mode) by:</p>

  <pre>
(3
  (4 12 17)
  5)
</pre>

</li>

  <li>Do the same thing, except for the data type defined by the
  constructor template

  <pre>
A Tree is a
-- (make-tree Number ListOfTree)   

A ListOfTree is one of
-- empty
-- (cons Tree ListOfTree)
</pre>
  For these trees, we define a leaf to be a tree with an empty list of
  daughters. 
  </li>

  <li>You are writing code for a navigation program.  You are to write
  a function called <kbd>distances-so-far</kbd> which, given a list of
  point-to-point distances, produces a list of distances to be
  displayed as "distance travelled so far"

  <pre>
EXAMPLE: Say there are 4 points on the route, called A, B, C, and D.
D is the destination.  The distance from A to B is 10, from B to C is
2, and from C to D is 5.  For this route, the input to your function
is the list
(10 2 5)
and your function should return the list
(0 10 12 17)
</pre>

</li>


</ol>
