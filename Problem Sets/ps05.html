<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 05: Working with Higher-Order Functions</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, October 12, 2015

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 19, 2015
at 600pm
local time
</p>


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions using 
higher-order functions like map, filter, foldr, etc.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Intermediate Student Language + Lambda to solve the
  problems.  You are to use HOFs wherever it is appropriate.  These
  will replace almost all the uses of the List template.</p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to follow our <a
  href="Info/coding-conventions.html" >coding conventions</a>.  This
  will make the TA's job much easier.</p>

<p>Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/VhJWTi5l7u" >Work Session Report for
  PS05</a>.</p>

  <li>(The absent-minded professors, part 2). Reimplement the last
  problem from last week's problem set (class-lists.rkt), but using
  HOFs wherever possible and appropriate.  Be sure to provide
  make-slip, slip-color, slip-name1 and slip-name2, which I forgot to
  specify in PS04.
</li>

<li>(screensaver-5). Rewrite screensaver-4 to use higher-order
functions whenever possible instead of using recursions down a list.
Provide the same functions you did for screensaver-4.
</p>

</li>

<li>The Registrar has heard about your excellent work with the
absent-minded professors that he asks you to solve the following
problem:

<p>You are given a list of (student, class) pairs.  Deliver a file 
called <kbd>rosters.rkt</kbd> that produces the class roster for each
class that has at least one student enrolled.  Here are more detailed
specifications: </p>

<pre>
A SetOfX is a list of X's without duplication.  Two SetofX's are
considered equal if they have the same members.

Example: (list (list 1 2) (list 2 1)) is NOT a SetofSetofNumbers,
because (list 1 2) and (list 2 1) represent the same set of numbers. 

An Enrollment is a (make-enrollment Student Class)
(make-enrollment s c) represents the assertion that student s is
enrolled in class c.

A ClassRoster is a (make-roster Class SetOfStudent)
(make-roster c ss) represents that the students in class c are exactly
the students in set ss.

Student is unspecified, but you may assume that students may be
compared for equality with equal?

Class is unspecified, but you may assume that classes may be
compared for equality with equal?

Two ClassRosters are equal if they have the same class and the same
set of students.  

You are to provide the following functions:

make-enrollment
enrollment-student
enrollment-class
make-roster
roster-classname
roster-students

roster=? : ClassRoster ClassRoster -> Boolean
RETURNS: true iff the two arguments represent the same roster

rosterset=? : SetOfClassRoster SetOfClassRoster -> Boolean
RETURNS: true iff the two arguments represent the same set of rosters

enrollments-to-rosters: SetOfEnrollment -> SetofClassRoster
GIVEN: a set of enrollments
RETURNS: the set of class rosters for the given enrollments

EXAMPLE:
  (enrollments-to-rosters
    (list (make-enrollment "John" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Kathryn" "Networks")
          (make-enrollment "Feng" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Amy" "PDP")
          (make-enrollment "Amy" "Networks")))
=>
 (list
   (make-roster "PDP" (list "John" "Feng" "Amy"))
   (make-roster "Networks" (list "Kathryn" "Amy")))

In the output, the classes may be in any order, and the students in
each class may be in any order.
</pre>

<p>As elsewhere in this problem set, use HOFs whenever possible and
appropriate. </p>

<p>For your tests, you may use any data type for Student and Class.
However, your code should not depend on your choice of data type; that
is, it should work for any definition of Student and Class (so long as
each is testable using equal?, as specified above).</p>

<p>Be sure that your tests accept <em>any</em> correct answer, not
just the one that your function happens to produce.  (Hint: don't use
<kbd>check-equal?</kbd>; instead use <kbd>check</kbd> with an
appropriate equality test.)</p>
