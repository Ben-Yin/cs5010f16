<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 8</h1>

<!-- Be sure to change the problem set number both in the title and -->
<!-- the h1! -->

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, November 2, 2015

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, November 9, 2015
at 600pm local time.
</p>


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to give you practice using everything
that you've learned this semester.
</p>

<p>These problems are a little more difficult than the ones we've
assigned recently, so leave yourself plenty of time to do them.</p>

<p>You must use DrScheme's HtDP Intermediate Student Language with
  Lambda. Use list abstractions like filter, fold, and map whenever
  they are helpful. As before, you will be penalized for failing to
  use these when they are "obviously" applicable. </p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe, and write
invariants (as WHERE clauses) whenever an argument represents context
information. We expect that your data definitions, interpretations, and invariants will
be sufficient to explain the meaning of every quantity in your
program.  You will be judged on the adequacy of these deliverables.</p>

<p>For each function that you write using general recursion, you must
deliver:

<ul>
  
  <li>A STRATEGY line describing briefly what you are recurring on.
  If the the value returned by the recursive call is not the final
  answer, describe briefly what you do with the result of the
  recursive call to obtain the final answer. Remember: the strategy is
  a tweet-sized description of how your function works.
  </li>

  <li>A HALTING MEASURE, specifying the quantity that you are
  proposing as a halting measure.</li>

  <li>A TERMINATION ARGUMENT, giving an informal proof that your
  proposed halting measure is always a non-negative integer and that
  it decreases at every recursive call.</li>

  <li>If your function fails to terminate for some inputs, explain
  which inputs those are.  (I don't believe there are any such
  functions on this problem set.)</li>

</ul>

<p>The example files contain numerous examples of the first three of
these deliverables.</p>

<p>You will be judged on the correctness of your halting measures and
termination arguments.</p>


<p>If you really need to do so, it is ok to write two
mutually-recursive functions using general recursion. If you do this, you need
make sure that your halting measure decreases on EVERY recursive call
to the function, even if that call comes via the other function.</p>

<p>As before, if your function does not fulfill its purpose for all
combinations of arguments that satisfy the contract, then you must
write an invariant that documents what additional assumptions your
function makes about its arguments.</p>


<p>Note: not everything on this problem set requires the use of
invariants or  the use of general recursion.  Part of your task
is to figure out when you need these things and when you do not.
Remember, it is the purpose statement that determines whether or not
you need to state an invariant.</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, strategies, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your
  work and fill out a Work Session Report at the end of every work
  session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/BrqzoRmPl4" >Work Session Report for
  PS08 </a>.</p> 


<p>As usual, the rubric for grading is <a
href="../Info/master-rubric-public.txt" >here</a>.

<li>
Consider the following definition of expressions:

<pre>
(define-struct sum-exp (exprs))
(define-struct diff-exp (exprs))

;; An Expr is one of
;; -- Integer
;; -- (make-sum-exp NELOExpr)
;; -- (make-diff-exp NELOExpr)
;; Interpretation: a sum-exp represents a sum and a diff-exp
;; represents a difference calculation. 

;; A LOExpr is one of
;; -- empty
;; -- (cons Expr LOExpr)

;; A NELOExpr is a non-empty LOExpr.
</pre>  

<p>Your task is to write  a program called <kbd>pretty.rkt</kbd> that contains
a pretty-printer for Exprs.  More precisely,
you are to provide a function </p>

<pre>
expr-to-strings : Expr NonNegInt -> ListOfString
GIVEN: An expression and a width
RETURNS: A representation of the expression as a sequence of lines, with
each line represented as a string of length not greater than the width.
</pre>

<p>The rules for rendering the expression as a list of lines are as follows:</p>

  <ol><p></p>
    <li>The expression should be rendered on a single line if it fits
    within the specified width.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, render the subexpressions in a stacked fashion,
    that is, like

    <pre>
	(+ expr1
	   expr2
	   ...
	   exprN)
</pre>
    and similarly for difference expressions.
    </li>
    
    <li>All subexpressions must fit within the space allotted minus the
    space for surrounding parentheses, if any.  Apply the rendering
    algorithm recursively if needed. </li>
    <li>Note: there should be no spaces preceding a right
    parenthesis.  </li>
    <li>The algorithm may determine that the given expression cannot fit
    within the allotted space.  In this case, the algorithm should raise
    an appropriate error, using the function <kbd>error</kbd>. 
  </ol>

  <p>In addition to expr-to-strings, you must provide make-sum-exp, sum-exp-exprs,
  make-diff-exp, and diff-exp-exprs.</p>

  <p>In addition, you must turn in a file containing the call graph for
  your program.  This file must show which functions call which, so we
  (and you) can see the overall structure of your program and find all
  the recursive calls.  You may turn this in as a text file, pdf, jpg,
  or Racket file.  Call your file <kbd>pretty-call-tree</kbd> with an
  appropriate suffix, and bring a paper copy to your codewalk.</p>

  <p>In order to help you debug your program, we have provided in
  <a href="extras.rkt"><kbd>extras.rkt</kbd></a> the function:</p>

  <pre>
display-strings! : ListOfString -> Void
GIVEN: a list of strings
EFFECT: displays the strings on separate lines
RETURNS: no value

Example:
> (display-strings! (list "xyz" "abc")) 
xyz
abc
> 
</pre>

  <p>Be sure to download a fresh copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
  ><kbd>extras.rkt</kbd></a> containing this function.</p> 

  <p>Here is a sample interaction:</p>
  <pre>
> hw-example-1
(make-sum-exp (list 22 333 44))
> (expr-to-strings hw-example-1 15)
(list "(+ 22 333 44)")
> (expr-to-strings hw-example-1 10)
(list "(+ 22" "   333" "   44)")
> 
> (define (display-expr expr n)
    (display-strings! (expr-to-strings expr n)))
> (display-expr hw-example-1 25)
(+ 22 333 44)
> (display-expr hw-example-1 10)
(+ 22
   333
   44)
> (display-expr hw-example-1 5)
not enough room
> hw-example-2
(make-sum-exp
 (list
  (make-diff-exp (list 22 3333 44))
  (make-diff-exp
   (list
    (make-sum-exp (list 66 67 68))
    (make-diff-exp (list 42 43))))
  (make-diff-exp (list 77 88))))
> (display-expr hw-example-2 100)
(+ (- 22 3333 44) (- (+ 66 67 68) (- 42 43)) (- 77 88))
> (display-expr hw-example-2 50)
(+ (- 22 3333 44)
   (- (+ 66 67 68) (- 42 43))
   (- 77 88))
> (display-expr hw-example-2 20)
(+ (- 22 3333 44)
   (- (+ 66 67 68)
      (- 42 43))
   (- 77 88))
> (display-expr hw-example-2 15)
(+ (- 22
      3333
      44)
   (- (+ 66
         67
         68)
      (- 42
         43))
   (- 77 88))
> 
</pre>

<p>Here are some hints on this problem.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>display-strings!</kbd> is useful for you to use in
    debugging your program, but we will be testing the lists of
    strings produced by expr-to-strngs.  There is at most one list of
    strings that satisfies the requirements of the problem.</li>

    <li>This problem requires careful analysis of the context.  For
    example, when your program gets to the (- 42 43) in
    (expr-to-strings hw-example-2 20), what does it need to know about
    the context in order to produce this line?  If there is more than
    one thing that it needs to know, you can introduce multiple
    context variables to keep track of them.
   </li>

   <li>In the book, you will find two <em>different</em> data
   definitions for non-empty lists.  One of these treats the first
   element of the list specially; the other treats the last one
   specially.  I needed both in my solution; I suspect you will also
   need both.  Be sure to write down both definitions and both
   templates, and be sure to indicate which one you are using when you
   use structural decomposition on a non-empty list.</li>
    
 </ul>

</li>
</li>

<li>Imagine an infinite chessboard. The chessboard extends infinitely
in all directions. You can think of the positions on the board as
pairs of integers.

<p>On the chessboard, we have a robot and some blocks.  The robot
occupies a single square on the chessboard, as does each of the
blocks.  The robot can move any number of squares in any diagonal
direction, but it can never move to or through a square occupied by a
block.  In this way, its behavior is like that of a bishop in chess.
</p>

<p>You are to write a file called <kbd>robot.rkt</kbd> that provides the
following functions:
</p>

<pre>
path : Position Position ListOfPosition -> MaybePlan
GIVEN:
1. the starting position of the robot,
2. the target position that robot is supposed to reach
3. A list of the blocks on the board
RETURNS: a plan that, when executed, will take the robot from
the starting position to the target position without passing over any
of the blocks, or false if no such sequence of moves exists.

eval-plan : Position ListOfPosition Plan ->  MaybePosition
GIVEN:
1. the starting position of the robot,
2. A list of the blocks on the board
3. A plan for the robot's motion
RETURNS:
The position of the robot at the end of executing the plan, or false
if  the plan sends the robot to or  through any block.
</pre>

This API uses the following data definitions:

<pre>
;; A Position is a (list Integer Integer)
;; (list x y) represents the position (x,y).
;; Note: this is not to be confused with the built-in data type Posn.

;; A Move is a (list Direction PosInt)
;; Interp: a move of the specified number of steps in the indicated
;; direction. 

;; A Direction is one of
;; -- "ne"
;; -- "se"
;; -- "sw"
;; -- "nw"

;; A Plan is a ListOfMove
;; WHERE: the list does not contain two consecutive moves in the same
;; direction.
;; INTERP: the moves are to be executed from the first in the list to
;; the last in the list.
</pre>

<p>Here are some examples that your program should be able to handle
easily.  Why do the first two fail, but the other two succeed? 
I haven't shown solutions to the second two, because there are many
correct answers.  Your tests should accept any correct answer.
</p>

<pre>
(define wall1
  '((0 3)(2 3)(4 3)
    (0 5)     (4 5)
    (0 7)(2 7)(4 7)))

(define two-walls
  '((0 3)(4 3)
    (0 5)(4 5)
    (0 7)(4 7)
    (0 9)(4 9)
    (0 11)(4 11)))

(path (list 2 5) (list 2 6) empty)
(path (list 2 5) (list 4 9) wall1)
(path (list 2 5) (list 4 9) (rest wall1))
(path (list -3 6) (list 7 6) two-walls)
</pre>

<p>Your tests should also check that if you run <kbd>eval-plan</kbd> on the
output of <kbd>path</kbd>, you get to the desired position.
</p>

<p>For this problem also, you must turn in a file containing the call
  graph for your program.  This file must show which functions call
  which, so we (and you) can see the overall structure of your program
  and find all the recursive calls.  You may turn this in as a text
  file, pdf, jpg, or Racket file.  Call your file
  <kbd>robot-call-tree</kbd> with an appropriate suffix, and bring a
  paper copy to your codewalk.</p>
