<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 6</h1>

<!-- Be sure to change the problem set number both in the title and -->
<!-- the h1! -->

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, October 13, 2014

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 20, 2014
at 600pm local time.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design and use
multiply-recursive and mutually-recursive data definitions, and to
give you practice using the list abstractions and HOFC.
</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe. </p>

<p>You must use DrScheme's HtDP Intermediate Student Language with
  Lambda.</p>

<p>As usual, the rubric for` grading is <a
href="../Info/master-rubric-public.txt" >here</a>. You should also
refer to the more detailed guidelines <a
href="http://bit.ly/cs5010f14-guidelines" >here</a>.</p>

<h2>Required Exercise</h2>

  In this problem, you will design and implement a system for a
  graphical interface for trees.  Your system will allow you to create
  and manipulate trees on a canvas.  Create a file called "trees.rkt"
  with the following properties: <p></p>

  <ol>

    <li>The canvas starts empty. Its size is 500 pixels wide by 400
    pixels high.</li>

    <li>Nodes of the tree are rendered as green outline circles of a
    fixed radius.  The default value for the radius
    is 10, but your system should allow you to change the radius for
    the next run by changing a single line of your code.</li>

    <li>When the tree is displayed, there should be a straight blue
    line from the center of a node to the center of each of its
    sons.</li>

    <li> You can select a node by clicking on it, as in previous
    problems.  Selected nodes are displayed as green solid
    circles. Clicking on a node selects only the node, not any of its
    subtrees.  If the mouse is clicked in the overlap of two or more
    nodes, all the nodes are selected, even if one node is a son or
    descendant of the other. </li>

    <li>When a node is selected, there should be a vertical line
    displayed <span class="new">at the position where the left edge of
    a new son would be if it were created.  (See the "n" command,
    below).</span>

<span class="strike">  3 circle-lengths to the left of that node's leftmost son.
  This delimits the area in which new sons may be created. (See the
  "n" command, below). If the selected node has no sons, no line
  should be displayed</span>
 </li>

  <li> Dragging a selected node causes the entire tree rooted at that
  node to be dragged.  The relative positions of all the nodes in the
  subtree should stay the same.  It is ok if this action causes some
  nodes to be moved off the edge of the canvas; if the node is moved
  again so that they are now back on the canvas, they should reappear
  in the proper place.</li>

  <li><span class="new">When you drag a node, the rectangle should
  become centered on the mouse position.  (That is, we are not doing
  "smooth dragging" in this problem.</span></li>
  
  <li> Hitting "t" at any time creates a new root node in the center of the top
  of the canvas. The root appears tangent to the top of the canvas and
  initially has no sons.</li>

  <li> Hitting "n" while a node is selected adds a new son, whose
  center has an x-coordinate two radii to the left of the center of
  the currently leftmost son, and a y-coordinate 3 radii down from the
  center of the parent.  If a selected node ever moves into a position
  so that there is no room for the son, it should appear as red solid
  rather than green, and "n" has no effect.  The first son of a node
  should appear 3 radii down and directly beneath the
  node. There is room for a new son if it would be placed with the
  whole circle entirely within the canvas. Note that a node should
  turn red at the same instant that its vertical line disappears off
  the left edge of the screen.</li>

  <li> Hitting "d" while a node is selected deletes the node and its
  whole subtree. </li>

  <li>Hitting "u" (whether a node is selected or not) deletes every
  node <span>whose center is</span> in the upper half of
  the canvas. (If a node is deleted, all of its children are also
  deleted.)</li>

  </ol> <!-- end requirements list -->

    <p>Here's a small demo.  It doesn't demonstrate "u", though, nor
    does it demonstrate having multiple roots on the screen, sorry. </p>

</center></p>

<p>  Your solution should provide the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
initial-world : -> World
GIVEN: no arguments
RETURNS: an initial world.  The given value is ignored.

run :  -> World
GIVEN: no arguments
EFFECT: runs a copy of an initial world
RETURNS: the final state of the world.  

world-after-mouse-event : World Integer Integer MouseEvent -> World
GIVEN: a World, a location, and a MouseEvent
RETURNS: the state of the world as it should be following the given mouse event at that location.

world-after-key-event : World KeyEvent -> World
GIVEN: a World and a key event
RETURNS: the state of the world as it should be following the given key event
 
world-to-trees : World -> ListOfTree
GIVEN: a World
RETURNS: a list of all the trees in the given world.

tree-to-root : Tree -> Node
tree-to-sons : Tree -> ListOfTree
GIVEN: a tree
RETURNS: the node at the root of the tree, or its sons.

node-to-center : Node -> Posn
RETURNS: the center of the given node as it is to be displayed on the
scene.
Note: this function returns a Posn (an ISL builtin).  This is for the
convenience of the testing framework, and you may or may not wish to
represent the center of the node in this way.

node-to-selected? : Node -> Boolean
RETURNS: true iff the given node is selected.
</pre>

  <p> Before you turn in your solution, make sure it passes the tests
  in <a href="ps05-qualification.rkt"
  ><kbd>ps05-qualification.rkt</kbd></a>.   As before,
  download this file, save it in your set05 directory, and run it to
  qualify your program for grading.  Be sure to commit this file to the repository
  so we know that you've done this correctly.  <span
  class="new"><strong>DO NOT TURN IN YOUR SOLUTION UNLESS IT PASSES
  THE QUALIFICATION TEST!  IF YOUR SOLUTION DOES NOT PASS THE
  QUALIFICATION TEST, WE MAY NOT GRADE IT.</strong></span></p>

  <p><span class="new">Please download a fresh copy of
  <a href="extras.rkt" >extras.rkt</a> for
  this problem set.  The new version should print out a header showing
  a version date.  For this problem, be sure the version you have is
  dated later than Wed Oct 15 13:00:00 2014.  When you run your
  qualification test, if you get a message
  like "undefined function <kbd>check-location</kbd>", it means that
  your version of extras.rkt is too old and you need to download the
  latest one.  </span></p>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  
  <li> Follow the design recipe!!  If you write good data definitions,
  and follow the templates, you will be led to a good solution.  If
  you stray from the templates, you <strong>will</strong> create a
  mess.  If you are following your templates and still creating a
  mess, try an alternate path.  For example, if you are doing
  structural decomposition on one data type, followed immediately by
  structural decomposition on another data type, try doing them in the
  other order.</li>
  
<li>The built-in abstraction functions, like map, foldr, and filter,
are your friends.  Use them wherever it is feasible to do so.  As before,
you may want to write your functions using explicit recursions, and
then rewrite them using the abstractions and higher-order function
combination.  You will be penalized for recursions in your code that
"obviously" could have been replaced by HOFC.</li>

  <li>Most likely you will want to use <kbd>scene+line</kbd> from the image
  library rather than <kbd>add-line</kbd>, since the latter changes the
  dimensions of the image in surprising ways.</li>

  <li>My solution to this problem was about 320 lines, plus tests.  Median
  time on task for this problem for the last two semesters has been
  right around 20 hours.</li>
