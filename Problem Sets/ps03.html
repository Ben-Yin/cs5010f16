<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 03: Iterative Design</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, September 28, 2015

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 5, 2015
at 600pm
local time
</p>

<!-- See Google spreadsheet for collected problem sets and TOTs -->


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions that deal
with the Universe model, and to give you practice with the Iterative
Design Recipe.</p>

<p>You will also get experience with the Perfect Bounce and Smooth
Dragging, which we will be using in many of our exercises.</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Beginning Student Language to solve the
  problems.  </p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/homework.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/A8bzacx7NF" >Work Session Report for
  PS03</a>.</p> 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs, you may assume
that the mouse is never dragged or moved outside of the canvas.  Once
the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas, then
the behavior of your system is unspecified.</p>

<ol>

  <li>(screensaver-1).  Your boss has assigned you to a project to
  build a screensaver.  The specifications for the screensaver are as
  follows:<p></p>

  <ul>

    <li> The screensaver is a universe program that displays two
    rectangles that move around a canvas.</li>

    <li>The rectangles bounce smoothly off the edge of the
    canvas. Bouncing is defined as follows: if the rectangle would hit
    or go past one side of the canvas, then at the next tick it should
    appear tangent to the edge of the canvas, travelling at the same
    speed, but in the opposite direction (that is, away from the
    wall).  If the rectangle would go past a corner, then both the x-
    and y- velocities are both reversed.  We call this a <em>perfect
    bounce</em>.  </li>


    <li> Each rectangle is displayed as an outline blue rectangle 60
    pixels wide and 50 pixels high. In addition, the rectangle's
    current velocity is displayed as a string (vx, vy) in the center
    of the rectangle.  </li>


    <li>The space bar pauses or unpauses the entire simulation.  The
    simulation is initially paused.
    </li>


    <li>The canvas is 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels high.
    </li>

    <li> The two rectangles are initially centered at positions
    (200,100) and (200,200), and have velocities of (-12, 20) and (23,
    -14), respectively. Remember that we are using computer-graphics
    coordinates, in which y increases as you go down the page
    (south).</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Here's a demo:</p>


  <p><center>
<video src="ps03-demo1.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>




  <p>You are to deliver a file named <kbd>screensaver-1.rkt</kbd> that
  provides the following functions:</p>

  <pre>
;; screensaver : PosReal -> WorldState
;; GIVEN: the speed of the simulation, in seconds/tick
;; EFFECT: runs the simulation, starting with specified initial state.
;; RETURNS: the final state of the world

;; initial-world : Any -> WorldState
;; GIVEN: any value (ignored)
;; RETURNS: the specified initial world.

;; world-after-tick : WorldState -> WorldState
;; RETURNS: the world state that should follow the given world state
;; after a tick.

;; world-after-key-event : WorldState KeyEvent -> WorldState
;; RETURNS: the WorldState that should follow the given worldstate
;; after the given keyevent

;; world-rect1 : WorldState -> Rectangle
;; world-rect2 : WorldState -> Rectangle
;; world-paused? : WorldState -> Rectangle
;; RETURNS: the specified attribute of the WorldState
;; NOTE: if these are part of the world struct, you don't need to
;; write any deliverables for these functions.

;; new-rectangle : PosInt PosInt Int Int -> Rectangle
;; GIVEN: 2 positive integers x and y, and 2 integers vx and vy
;; RETURNS: a rectangle centered at (x,y), which will travel with
;; velocity (vx, vy).

;; rect-x : Rectangle -> PosInt
;; rect-y : Rectangle -> PosInt
;; rect-vx : Rectangle -> Int
;; rect-vy : Rectangle -> Int
;; RETURNS: the coordinates of the center of the rectangle and its
;; velocity in the x- and y- directions.
</pre>

</li>


<li>(screensaver-2).  Your boss has now decided to build a better
    screensaver.  This one is like the original, except for the
    following:<p></p>

  <ul>

    <li> The rectangle is selectable and draggable.  Depressing the
    mouse button within the rectangle causes the rectangle to be
    "selected".  When the rectangle is selected, it and its velocity
    are displayed in red instead of blue.</li>

    <li>The location where the mouse grabbed the rectangle should be
    indicated by an outline red circle of radius 5 pixels. Simply
    pressing the mouse button, without moving the mouse, should not
    cause the rectangle to move on the canvas.  </li>

    <li>Once the rectangle has been selected, you should be able to
    drag it around the Universe canvas with the mouse.  As you drag
    it, the position of the mouse within the rectangle (as indicated
    by the red circle), should not change.  When the mouse button is
    released, the rectangle should go back to its unselected state
    (outline blue) in its new location.  </li>

    <li>All of this works whether or not the simulation is paused.
    </li>


    <li>We refer to this behavior as "smooth dragging."  We will be
    implementing other objects with this behavior in future problem
    sets.  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Here's a demo:</p>

  <p><center>
<video src="ps03-demo2.mp4" controls />
</center>
</p>

  <p>Your file should provide all the functions above, plus the following:</p>

  <pre>
;; world-after-mouse-event : WorldState Int Int MouseEvent -> WorldState
;; RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after the given mouse
;; event.

;; rect-after-mouse-event :  Rectangle Int Int MouseEvent -> Rectangle
;; RETURNS: the rectangle that should follow the given rectangle after
;; the given mouse event

;; new-rectangle
;; as before, but now it returns an UNSELECTED rectangle.
</pre>


</ul>
</li>

</ol>
