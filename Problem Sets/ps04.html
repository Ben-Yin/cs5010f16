<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 04: Working with Lists</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, October 5, 2015

<p><strong>Due:</strong> Monday, October 12, 2015
at 600pm
local time
</p>


<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions that deal
with lists, and with the Iterative Design Recipe</p>

<p>You must use the HtDP Beginning Student Language to solve the
  problems.  </p>

<p>For these problems, download a copy of <a href="extras.rkt"
>extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.  Then
import this library by including the line

<pre>
(require "extras.rkt")
</pre>

at the top of your file with the other requires.  Then, for each
problem, put in lines that say

<pre>
(provide <em>function</em>)
</pre>

for each deliverable function, as you have done on previous problem sets.
This will allow our testing framework to import your file and do
automated testing on it.</p>


<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.  Your <a
  href="../Info/deliverables.html" >deliverables</a> include the data
  definitions (including interpretation and templates), contract and
  purpose header, code, and tests.  Be sure to sync your work and fill
  out a Work Session Report at the end of every work session.  Use the

<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/QrmfelUUbX" >Work Session Report for
  PS04</a>.</p> 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For all universe programs, you may assume
that the mouse is never dragged or moved outside of the canvas.  Once
the mouse enters the canvas, if the mouse ever leaves the canvas, then
the behavior of your system is unspecified.</p>

  <li>(screensaver-3).  Your boss has decided that your screensaver
  needs to show more stuff on the screen.  In the new screensaver,
  there will be a list of rectangles.

  <p>Initially, there are no rectangle.  Hitting the "n" key adds a
  new rectangle, at the center of the canvas, at rest (velocity is 0).</p>

  <p>When a rectangle is selected, the arrow keys increase the
  velocity of the rectangle in the specified direction (up, down,
  left, or right).  Each push of the arrow key increases the velocity
  by 2 pixels/tick.  </p>




  <p>You are to deliver a file named <kbd>screensaver-3.rkt</kbd> that
  provides all the functions of <kbd>screensaver-2.rkt</kbd>, plus the
  following: </p>

  <pre>
;; world-rects : WorldState -> ListOfRectangle
;; RETURNS: the specified attribute of the WorldState
;; NOTE: this replaces world-rect1 and world-rect2.
;; NOTE: if these are part of the world struct, you don't need to
;; write any deliverables for these functions.

;; rect-after-key-event : Rectangle KeyEvent -> Rectangle
;; RETURNS: the state of the rectangle that should follow the given
;; rectangle after the given key event
</pre>

</li>


<li>(screensaver-4).  Your boss is so pleased with your work that he
assigns you yet another feature.  Screensaver 4.0 adds the following
feature:

<p>When a rectangle is selected, the "d" key drops a pen down.  When
the pen is down, the rectangle records on the screen a dot marking its
center at each tick.  The dot is displayed as a solid black circle of
radius 1.  </p>

<p>When a rectangle is selected, the "u" key lifts the pen up.  When
the pen is up, the rectangle does not leave a track on the screen.
</p>

<p>You are to deliver a file named <kbd>screensaver-4.rkt</kbd> that
implements this functionality.  It should provide the same functions
as <kbd>screensaver-3</kbd>, plus a function <kbd>rect-pen-down?</kbd>
that tests whether the pen in the given rectangle is down or not.
</p>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Professor Felleisen and Professor Shivers each keep their class
lists on slips of paper, one student on each slip.  Professor
Felleisen keeps his list on slips of yellow paper.  Professor Shivers
keeps his list on slips of blue paper.

<p>Unfortunately, both professors are sloppy record-keepers.
Sometimes they have more than one slip for the same student.
Sometimes they record the student names first-name first; sometimes
they record the names last-name first.</p>

<p>One day, Professor Felleisen was walking up the stairs in WVH,
talking to one of his graduate students.  At the same time, Professor Shivers
was walking down the stairs, all the time talking to one <em>his</em>
graduate students.   They collided, and dropped all the slips
containing their class lists on the stairs, where they got all mixed
up.</p>

<p>Your job is to clean up this mess.  Deliver a file named
<kbd>class-lists.rkt</kbd> that provides the following functions:</p>

<pre>
felleisen-roster : ListOfSlip -> ListOfSlip
GIVEN: a list of slips
RETURNS: a list of slips containing all the students in Professor
Felleisen's class, without duplication.

shivers-roster: ListOfSlip -> ListOfSlip
GIVEN: a list of slips
RETURNS: a list of slips containing all the students in Professor
Shivers' class, without duplication.
</pre>

<p>Here is the beginning of the data definition for <kbd>ListOfSlip</kbd>:</p>

<pre>
(define-struct slip (color name1 name2))
A Slip is a (make-slip Color String String)

A Color is one of
-- "yellow"
-- "blue"
</pre>

<p>As mentioned before, the professors are confused about first names
and last names, so <kbd>(make-slip "yellow" "Wang" "Xi")</kbd> and
<kbd>(make-slip "yellow" "Xi" "Wang")</kbd> represent the same student
in Professor Felleisen's class.  The phrase "without duplication" in
the purpose statements above means that your function should return a
list in which this student is represented only once.  </p>

<p>Be sure to finish the data definitions I've started above.</p>
