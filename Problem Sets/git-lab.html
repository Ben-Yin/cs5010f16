<h1>Laboratory Exercise: Using Git</h1>

<p>In this course, we will use <a href="https://github.com" >Github</a>
as our version control and repository system.  The way in which we
will use git and github are explained <a href="../git.html" >here</a></p>


<div class="exercise">

<ol>

  <li>If you have not already done so, read the general introduction
  to git found <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PkOQjpY-6_-Kg-kjtR8riCWL1hICEx-gFZhORpy4ymk/edit?usp=sharing"
  >here</a>, and the watch the <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thrpcSzdvso" >video
  demonstration</a>.  </li>

  <li>If you have not already done so, download <a
  href="http://windows.github.com/" >Github for Windows</a> or <a
  href="http://mac.github.com/" >Github for Mac</a>. We will refer to
  either of these clients as GHF* (If you are
  using a Linux machine, you will have to use the command-line
  interface or git-gui, which should have been included in your
  distro.)  </li>
  
  <li>If you have not already done so, create an account for yourself
  on <a href="https://github.com" >Github</a>.  (You can do that
  directly from GHF* if you want). If you do not have any
  repositories in your account, click on the little book in the
  upper-right-hand corner to create a public repository.  
  </li>

  <li>Open GHF*, and click "LOG IN" to log in to your github account.
  The first time you do this, it will ask for your github login and
  password.  It will also give you a checkbox icon that says "always
  use REBASE".  Leave this box checked.
  
 <p> You should see your repository in the repository list. Select it,
  and mouse over to the right side of the entry.  A little down-arrow
  should appear.  Select it to clone this repository on your local
  machine.  (Don't worry, it gets simpler after this.)</p> </li>

  <li>
  Then click on the right arrow to open the repository. Click
  on the gear icon "tools" to open an explorer window pointing at the
  repository. </li>

  <li>Add a text file to the repository, using the tool of your
  choice.</li>

  <li>Now go back to GHF*.  You should see the blue message that says
  "uncommitted changes".  Click "SHOW" to display them. You can see
  the diffs. </li>

  <li>In the yellow box, write a commit message, and hit
  "COMMIT".</li>

  <li>Now you should see a display for "unsynced commits".</li>

  <li><strong>THIS NEXT PART IS VERY IMPORTANT!</strong><span
  style="color:red"> You see the panel that says "unsynced commits"?
  This means that you have made changes to the repository that have
  not been uploaded to the server.  Upload your changes to the server
  by clicking on the icon that says "sync" to upload them.  It will
  throb for a little while, and then switch to a checkmark that says
  "in sync". </span></li>

  <li>To see that your changes have been uploaded, click on "tools"
  again.  This time, select "view on github". </li>

  <li>A browser window should pop open with your repository.  You
  should see your new file there.</li>

  <li>Now let's edit the file in the brower. Click on the file to view
  it, and then click "edit".  A text window should open.  Edit the
  file a little.  Scroll down, change the commit message if you like,
  and hit "commit changes."</li>

  <li>Now let's download those changes into your local copy.  In GHF*,
  if you are still looking at your repository, hit F5 to
  refresh. (Otherwise just open your repository again, and it will
  refresh).  Now the "in sync" checkmark will be replaced by
  "refreshing..." .  Eventually the "sync" icon will appear. (If there
  were no changes on the server, it will go back to the "in sync"
  checkmark.) Click the sync icon to download the changes.  You will
  get a screen that says "no local changes". To see the changes that
  were made, click on the first panel in the "history" display. </li>
  </li>

</ol>
